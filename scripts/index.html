    <h1>Brief nod to our past</h1>
    <p>Sri lanka has been inhabitated since 2 million years ago and it's culture was
        greatly influenced by India.Sri lanka was a hub for maritime trade back in the old days
        due to it's unique position in the indian ocean. This advantageous position drew the eye pf many 
       potential infiltrators such as the dutch , english and portugese. We were visited by many foreign traders most notably
       visitors from the middle east.Sri lanka was as any other land accomodated hunter gatherers who used stone equipment 
         to survive. The earliest settlers were said to have belongeed to the proto-Australoid groups. Civilisation started gradually around building houses and establishing a hierachy 
         in society.Sri lanka has been inhabitated since 2 million years ago and it's culture was
