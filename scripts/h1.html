                    <h2>History</h2>
                   <p>The fortress present right at the top of the sigiriya rock was built by king kashyapa is located in Matale province. Sigiriya is a gargantuan rock 180 m high. 
                  It was deemed a world heritage site by UNESCO and Is the eighth wonder of the world. 
                  
                  Built by king kashyapa to his from his brother mugalan who was engaged at kashyapa for unjustly stealing the throne ,
                  King kashyapa managed to accomplish something even modern day researchers are unable to fathom.
                  Sigiriya has a water transportation site so complex that we stumped as to how it was built and it's impossible to figure out the transportation system's architecture.
                  Sigiriya rock was used as a buddist monastery before king kashyapa decided to build his empire atop it . However after his defeat at the hands of his brother , sigiriya reverted back to functioning as a buddist monastery. 
                  To this day sigiriya is a main tourist hub of Sri Lanka attracting about a million visitors per year.
